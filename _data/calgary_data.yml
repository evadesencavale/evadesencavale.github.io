  comment: Errol: This one is a bit difficult to rate, mainly because I've heard differing reports from those who didn't like the room because of tech and some GM issues. However, I absolutely loved what they did and the final solve made me cheer in the room. I haven't done that in a long time. Unfortunately, YMMV with this one, and it may be dependent on winning. Take an ace team, this room is definitely not for beginners.
